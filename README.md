## UPS Warehouse Venus Nova Envie

I reverse engineered the protocol to communicate with the UPS and made this web-based tool to control the device, because both the manufacturer and supplier were useless.

It's not perfect, there are some commands I haven't worked out yet... but it may be useful to you and save you some time...

### About the UPS
